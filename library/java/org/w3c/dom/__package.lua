---(Not exposed)
---The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire
--- Document Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree.
--- While all objects implementing the Node interface expose
--- methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the
--- Node interface may have children. For example,
--- Text nodes may not have children, and adding children to
--- such nodes results in a DOMException being raised.
--- The attributes nodeName, nodeValue and
--- attributes are included as a mechanism to get at node
--- information without casting down to the specific derived interface. In
--- cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a
--- specific nodeType (e.g., nodeValue for an
--- Element or attributes for a Comment
--- ), this returns null. Note that the specialized interfaces
--- may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the
--- relevant information.
--- The values of nodeName,
--- nodeValue, and attributes vary according to the
--- node type as follows:
---
