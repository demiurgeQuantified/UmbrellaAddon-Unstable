---(Not exposed)
---A Rectangle specifies an area in a coordinate space that is
--- enclosed by the Rectangle object's upper-left point
--- (x,y)
--- in the coordinate space, its width, and its height.
---
--- A Rectangle object's width and
--- height are public fields. The constructors
--- that create a Rectangle, and the methods that can modify
--- one, do not prevent setting a negative value for width or height.
---
---
--- A Rectangle whose width or height is exactly zero has location
--- along those axes with zero dimension, but is otherwise considered empty.
--- The isEmpty() method will return true for such a Rectangle.
--- Methods which test if an empty Rectangle contains or intersects
--- a point or rectangle will always return false if either dimension is zero.
--- Methods which combine such a Rectangle with a point or rectangle
--- will include the location of the Rectangle on that axis in the
--- result as if the add(Point) method were being called.
---
---
--- A Rectangle whose width or height is negative has neither
--- location nor dimension along those axes with negative dimensions.
--- Such a Rectangle is treated as non-existent along those axes.
--- Such a Rectangle is also empty with respect to containment
--- calculations and methods which test if it contains or intersects a
--- point or rectangle will always return false.
--- Methods which combine such a Rectangle with a point or rectangle
--- will ignore the Rectangle entirely in generating the result.
--- If two Rectangle objects are combined and each has a negative
--- dimension, the result will have at least one negative dimension.
---
---
--- Methods which affect only the location of a Rectangle will
--- operate on its location regardless of whether or not it has a negative
--- or zero dimension along either axis.
---
--- Note that a Rectangle constructed with the default no-argument
--- constructor will have dimensions of 0x0 and therefore be empty.
--- That Rectangle will still have a location of (0,0) and
--- will contribute that location to the union and add operations.
--- Code attempting to accumulate the bounds of a set of points should
--- therefore initially construct the Rectangle with a specifically
--- negative width and height or it should use the first point in the set
--- to construct the Rectangle.
--- For example:
--- <code>
---     Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(0, 0, -1, -1);
---     for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
---         bounds.add(points[i]);
---     }
--- </code>
--- or if we know that the points array contains at least one point:
--- <code>
---     Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(points[0]);
---     for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
---         bounds.add(points[i]);
---     }
--- </code>
---
--- This class uses 32-bit integers to store its location and dimensions.
--- Frequently operations may produce a result that exceeds the range of
--- a 32-bit integer.
--- The methods will calculate their results in a way that avoids any
--- 32-bit overflow for intermediate results and then choose the best
--- representation to store the final results back into the 32-bit fields
--- which hold the location and dimensions.
--- The location of the result will be stored into the x and
--- y fields by clipping the true result to the nearest 32-bit value.
--- The values stored into the width and height dimension
--- fields will be chosen as the 32-bit values that encompass the largest
--- part of the true result as possible.
--- Generally this means that the dimension will be clipped independently
--- to the range of 32-bit integers except that if the location had to be
--- moved to store it into its pair of 32-bit fields then the dimensions
--- will be adjusted relative to the "best representation" of the location.
--- If the true result had a negative dimension and was therefore
--- non-existent along one or both axes, the stored dimensions will be
--- negative numbers in those axes.
--- If the true result had a location that could be represented within
--- the range of 32-bit integers, but zero dimension along one or both
--- axes, then the stored dimensions will be zero in those axes.
