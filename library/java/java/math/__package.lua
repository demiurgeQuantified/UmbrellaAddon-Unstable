---Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.  All operations behave as if
--- BigIntegers were represented in two's-complement notation (like Java's
--- primitive integer types).  BigInteger provides analogues to all of Java's
--- primitive integer operators, and all relevant methods from java.lang.Math.
--- Additionally, BigInteger provides operations for modular arithmetic, GCD
--- calculation, primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation,
--- and a few other miscellaneous operations.
---
--- Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's integer
--- arithmetic operators, as defined in The Java Language Specification.
--- For example, division by zero throws an ArithmeticException, and
--- division of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.
---
--- Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators
--- to allow for negative shift distances.  A right-shift with a negative
--- shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned
--- right shift operator (>>>) is omitted since this operation
--- only makes sense for a fixed sized word and not for a
--- representation conceptually having an infinite number of leading
--- virtual sign bits.
---
--- Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's
--- bitwise integer operators.  The binary operators (and,
--- or, xor) implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter
--- of the two operands prior to performing the operation.
---
--- Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to
--- those performed by Java's relational and equality operators.
---
--- Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
--- exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.  These methods always
--- return a non-negative result, between 0 and (modulus - 1),
--- inclusive.
---
--- Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement
--- representation of their operand.  If necessary, the operand is sign-extended
--- so that it contains the designated bit.  None of the single-bit
--- operations can produce a BigInteger with a different sign from the
--- BigInteger being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the
--- arbitrarily large abstraction provided by this class ensures that conceptually
--- there are infinitely many "virtual sign bits" preceding each BigInteger.
---
--- For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the
--- descriptions of BigInteger methods.  The pseudo-code expression
--- (i + j) is shorthand for "a BigInteger whose value is
--- that of the BigInteger i plus that of the BigInteger j."
--- The pseudo-code expression (i == j) is shorthand for
--- "true if and only if the BigInteger i represents the same
--- value as the BigInteger j."  Other pseudo-code expressions are
--- interpreted similarly.
---
--- All methods and constructors in this class throw
--- NullPointerException when passed
--- a null object reference for any input parameter.
---
--- BigInteger must support values in the range
--- -2Integer.MAX_VALUE (exclusive) to
--- +2Integer.MAX_VALUE (exclusive)
--- and may support values outside of that range.
---
--- An ArithmeticException is thrown when a BigInteger
--- constructor or method would generate a value outside of the
--- supported range.
---
--- The range of probable prime values is limited and may be less than
--- the full supported positive range of BigInteger.
--- The range must be at least 1 to 2500000000.
