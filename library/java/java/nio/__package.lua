---A byte buffer.
---
---  This class defines six categories of operations upon
--- byte buffers:
---
---
---
---    Absolute and relative get and
---   put methods that read and write
---   single bytes;
---
---    Absolute and relative bulk get
---   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from this buffer
---   into an array;
---
---    Absolute and relative bulk put
---   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a
---   byte array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some other byte
---   buffer into this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and}
---
---
---
---    Absolute and relative get
---   and put methods that read and
---   write values of other primitive types, translating them to and from
---   sequences of bytes in a particular byte order;
---
---    Methods for creating view buffers,
---   which allow a byte buffer to be viewed as a buffer containing values of
---   some other primitive type; and
---
---
---
---    A method for compacting
---   a byte buffer.
---
---
---
---  Byte buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's
---
---
---
--- content, or by wrapping an
--- existing byte array {#if[char]?or&#32;string} into a buffer.
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---  Direct vs. non-direct buffers
---
---  A byte buffer is either direct or non-direct.  Given a
--- direct byte buffer, the Java virtual machine will make a best effort to
--- perform native I/O operations directly upon it.  That is, it will attempt to
--- avoid copying the buffer's content to (or from) an intermediate buffer
--- before (or after) each invocation of one of the underlying operating
--- system's native I/O operations.
---
---  A direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the allocateDirect factory method of this class.  The
--- buffers returned by this method typically have somewhat higher allocation
--- and deallocation costs than non-direct buffers.  The contents of direct
--- buffers may reside outside of the normal garbage-collected heap, and so
--- their impact upon the memory footprint of an application might not be
--- obvious.  It is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated
--- primarily for large, long-lived buffers that are subject to the underlying
--- system's native I/O operations.  In general it is best to allocate direct
--- buffers only when they yield a measurable gain in program performance.
---
---  A direct byte buffer may also be created by mapping a region of a file
--- directly into memory.  An implementation of the Java platform may optionally
--- support the creation of direct byte buffers from native code via JNI.  If an
--- instance of one of these kinds of buffers refers to an inaccessible region
--- of memory then an attempt to access that region will not change the buffer's
--- content and will cause an unspecified exception to be thrown either at the
--- time of the access or at some later time.
---
---  Whether a byte buffer is direct or non-direct may be determined by
--- invoking its isDirect method.  This method is provided so
--- that explicit buffer management can be done in performance-critical code.
---
---
---
---  Access to binary data
---
---  This class defines methods for reading and writing values of all other
--- primitive types, except boolean.  Primitive values are translated
--- to (or from) sequences of bytes according to the buffer's current byte
--- order, which may be retrieved and modified via the order
--- methods.  Specific byte orders are represented by instances of the ByteOrder class.  The initial order of a byte buffer is always BIG_ENDIAN.
---
---  For access to heterogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of
--- different types, this class defines a family of absolute and relative
--- get and put methods for each type.  For 32-bit floating-point
--- values, for example, this class defines:
---
---
--- float  <a href="#getFloat()"><code>getFloat()</code></a>
--- float  <a href="#getFloat(int)"><code>getFloat(int index)</code></a>
---  void  <a href="#putFloat(float)"><code>putFloat(float f)</code></a>
---  void  <a href="#putFloat(int,float)"><code>putFloat(int index, float f)</code></a>
---
---  Corresponding methods are defined for the types char,
--- short, int, long, and double.  The index
--- parameters of the absolute get and put methods are in terms of
--- bytes rather than of the type being read or written.
---
---
---
---  For access to homogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of
--- the same type, this class defines methods that can create views of a
--- given byte buffer.  A view buffer is simply another buffer whose
--- content is backed by the byte buffer.  Changes to the byte buffer's content
--- will be visible in the view buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers'
--- position, limit, and mark values are independent.  The asFloatBuffer method, for example, creates an instance of
--- the FloatBuffer class that is backed by the byte buffer upon which
--- the method is invoked.  Corresponding view-creation methods are defined for
--- the types char, short, int, long, and double.
---
---  View buffers have three important advantages over the families of
--- type-specific get and put methods described above:
---
---
---
---    A view buffer is indexed not in terms of bytes but rather in terms
---   of the type-specific size of its values;
---
---    A view buffer provides relative bulk get and put
---   methods that can transfer contiguous sequences of values between a buffer
---   and an array or some other buffer of the same type; and
---
---    A view buffer is potentially much more efficient because it will
---   be direct if, and only if, its backing byte buffer is direct.
---
---
---
---  The byte order of a view buffer is fixed to be that of its byte buffer
--- at the time that the view is created.

---
---  Invocation chaining
---
---
---  Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
--- specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
--- method invocations to be chained.
---
---
---
--- The sequence of statements
---
---
--- bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE);
--- bb.putShort(3);
--- bb.putShort(45);
---
--- can, for example, be replaced by the single statement
---
---
--- bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE).putShort(3).putShort(45);

---(Not exposed)
---A char buffer.
---
---  This class defines four categories of operations upon
--- char buffers:
---
---
---
---    Absolute and relative get and
---   put methods that read and write
---   single chars;
---
---    Absolute and relative bulk get
---   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of chars from this buffer
---   into an array; and
---
---    Absolute and relative bulk put
---   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of chars from a
---   char array{#if[char]?,&#32;a&#32;string,} or some other char
---   buffer into this buffer;{#if[!byte]?&#32;and}
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---    A method for compacting
---   a char buffer.
---
---
---
---  Char buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
---
--- content, by wrapping an existing
--- char array {#if[char]?or&#32;string} into a buffer, or by creating a
--- view of an existing byte buffer.

--- be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
--- a char buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the isDirect method.
---
---
---
---
---
---  This class implements the CharSequence interface so that
--- character buffers may be used wherever character sequences are accepted, for
--- example in the regular-expression package java.util.regex.
--- The methods defined by CharSequence operate relative to the current
--- position of the buffer when they are invoked.
