---A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate
--- operations.  The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using
--- Stream and IntStream:
---
--- <code>
---     int sum = widgets.stream()
---                      .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)
---                      .mapToInt(w -> w.getWeight())
---                      .sum();
--- </code>
---
--- In this example, widgets is a Collection<Widget>.  We create
--- a stream of Widget objects via Collection.stream(),
--- filter it to produce a stream containing only the red widgets, and then
--- transform it into a stream of int values representing the weight of
--- each red widget. Then this stream is summed to produce a total weight.
---
--- In addition to Stream, which is a stream of object references,
--- there are primitive specializations for IntStream, LongStream,
--- and DoubleStream, all of which are referred to as "streams" and
--- conform to the characteristics and restrictions described here.
---
--- To perform a computation, stream
--- operations are composed into a
--- stream pipeline.  A stream pipeline consists of a source (which
--- might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel,
--- etc), zero or more intermediate operations (which transform a
--- stream into another stream, such as filter(Predicate)), and a
--- terminal operation (which produces a result or side-effect, such
--- as count() or forEach(Consumer)).
--- Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is only performed when the
--- terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only
--- as needed.
---
--- A stream implementation is permitted significant latitude in optimizing
--- the computation of the result.  For example, a stream implementation is free
--- to elide operations (or entire stages) from a stream pipeline -- and
--- therefore elide invocation of behavioral parameters -- if it can prove that
--- it would not affect the result of the computation.  This means that
--- side-effects of behavioral parameters may not always be executed and should
--- not be relied upon, unless otherwise specified (such as by the terminal
--- operations forEach and forEachOrdered). (For a specific
--- example of such an optimization, see the API note documented on the
--- count() operation.  For more detail, see the
--- side-effects section of the
--- stream package documentation.)
---
--- Collections and streams, while bearing some superficial similarities,
--- have different goals.  Collections are primarily concerned with the efficient
--- management of, and access to, their elements.  By contrast, streams do not
--- provide a means to directly access or manipulate their elements, and are
--- instead concerned with declaratively describing their source and the
--- computational operations which will be performed in aggregate on that source.
--- However, if the provided stream operations do not offer the desired
--- functionality, the BaseStream.iterator() and BaseStream.spliterator() operations
--- can be used to perform a controlled traversal.
---
--- A stream pipeline, like the "widgets" example above, can be viewed as
--- a query on the stream source.  Unless the source was explicitly
--- designed for concurrent modification (such as a ConcurrentHashMap),
--- unpredictable or erroneous behavior may result from modifying the stream
--- source while it is being queried.
---
--- Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified
--- behavior, such as the lambda expression w -> w.getWeight() passed to
--- mapToInt in the example above.  To preserve correct behavior,
--- these behavioral parameters:
---
--- must be non-interfering
--- (they do not modify the stream source); and
--- in most cases must be stateless
--- (their result should not depend on any state that might change during execution
--- of the stream pipeline).
---
---
--- Such parameters are always instances of a
--- functional interface such
--- as Function, and are often lambda expressions or
--- method references.  Unless otherwise specified these parameters must be
--- non-null.
---
--- A stream should be operated on (invoking an intermediate or terminal stream
--- operation) only once.  This rules out, for example, "forked" streams, where
--- the same source feeds two or more pipelines, or multiple traversals of the
--- same stream.  A stream implementation may throw IllegalStateException
--- if it detects that the stream is being reused. However, since some stream
--- operations may return their receiver rather than a new stream object, it may
--- not be possible to detect reuse in all cases.
---
--- Streams have a BaseStream.close() method and implement AutoCloseable.
--- Operating on a stream after it has been closed will throw IllegalStateException.
--- Most stream instances do not actually need to be closed after use, as they
--- are backed by collections, arrays, or generating functions, which require no
--- special resource management. Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel,
--- such as those returned by Files.lines(Path), will require closing. If a
--- stream does require closing, it must be opened as a resource within a try-with-resources
--- statement or similar control structure to ensure that it is closed promptly after its
--- operations have completed.
---
--- Stream pipelines may execute either sequentially or in
--- parallel.  This
--- execution mode is a property of the stream.  Streams are created
--- with an initial choice of sequential or parallel execution.  (For example,
--- Collection.stream() creates a sequential stream,
--- and Collection.parallelStream() creates
--- a parallel one.)  This choice of execution mode may be modified by the
--- BaseStream.sequential() or BaseStream.parallel() methods, and may be queried with
--- the BaseStream.isParallel() method.
