---Lock implementations provide more extensive locking
--- operations than can be obtained using synchronized methods
--- and statements.  They allow more flexible structuring, may have
--- quite different properties, and may support multiple associated
--- Condition objects.
---
--- A lock is a tool for controlling access to a shared resource by
--- multiple threads. Commonly, a lock provides exclusive access to a
--- shared resource: only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and
--- all access to the shared resource requires that the lock be
--- acquired first. However, some locks may allow concurrent access to
--- a shared resource, such as the read lock of a ReadWriteLock.
---
--- The use of synchronized methods or statements provides
--- access to the implicit monitor lock associated with every object, but
--- forces all lock acquisition and release to occur in a block-structured way:
--- when multiple locks are acquired they must be released in the opposite
--- order, and all locks must be released in the same lexical scope in which
--- they were acquired.
---
--- While the scoping mechanism for synchronized methods
--- and statements makes it much easier to program with monitor locks,
--- and helps avoid many common programming errors involving locks,
--- there are occasions where you need to work with locks in a more
--- flexible way. For example, some algorithms for traversing
--- concurrently accessed data structures require the use of
--- &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; or &quot;chain locking&quot;: you
--- acquire the lock of node A, then node B, then release A and acquire
--- C, then release B and acquire D and so on.  Implementations of the
--- Lock interface enable the use of such techniques by
--- allowing a lock to be acquired and released in different scopes,
--- and allowing multiple locks to be acquired and released in any
--- order.
---
--- With this increased flexibility comes additional
--- responsibility. The absence of block-structured locking removes the
--- automatic release of locks that occurs with synchronized
--- methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom
--- should be used:
---
---  <code>
--- Lock l = ...;
--- l.lock();
--- try {
---   // access the resource protected by this lock
--- } finally {
---   l.unlock();
--- }</code>
---
--- When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be
--- taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is
--- held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the
--- lock is released when necessary.
---
--- Lock implementations provide additional functionality
--- over the use of synchronized methods and statements by
--- providing a non-blocking attempt to acquire a lock (tryLock()), an attempt to acquire the lock that can be
--- interrupted (lockInterruptibly(), and an attempt to acquire
--- the lock that can timeout (tryLock(long, TimeUnit)).
---
--- A Lock class can also provide behavior and semantics
--- that is quite different from that of the implicit monitor lock,
--- such as guaranteed ordering, non-reentrant usage, or deadlock
--- detection. If an implementation provides such specialized semantics
--- then the implementation must document those semantics.
---
--- Note that Lock instances are just normal objects and can
--- themselves be used as the target in a synchronized statement.
--- Acquiring the
--- monitor lock of a Lock instance has no specified relationship
--- with invoking any of the lock() methods of that instance.
--- It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use Lock
--- instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
---
--- Except where noted, passing a null value for any
--- parameter will result in a NullPointerException being
--- thrown.
---
--- Memory Synchronization
---
--- All Lock implementations must enforce the same
--- memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor
--- lock, as described in
--- Chapter 17 of
--- The Java Language Specification:
---
--- A successful lock operation has the same memory
--- synchronization effects as a successful Lock action.
--- A successful unlock operation has the same
--- memory synchronization effects as a successful Unlock action.
---
---
--- Unsuccessful locking and unlocking operations, and reentrant
--- locking/unlocking operations, do not require any memory
--- synchronization effects.
---
--- Implementation Considerations
---
--- The three forms of lock acquisition (interruptible,
--- non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their performance
--- characteristics, ordering guarantees, or other implementation
--- qualities.  Further, the ability to interrupt the ongoing
--- acquisition of a lock may not be available in a given Lock
--- class.  Consequently, an implementation is not required to define
--- exactly the same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of
--- lock acquisition, nor is it required to support interruption of an
--- ongoing lock acquisition.  An implementation is required to clearly
--- document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
--- locking methods. It must also obey the interruption semantics as
--- defined in this interface, to the extent that interruption of lock
--- acquisition is supported: which is either totally, or only on
--- method entry.
---
--- As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
--- interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
--- to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
--- shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
--- the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.

---(Not exposed)
---A reentrant mutual exclusion Lock with the same basic
--- behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
--- synchronized methods and statements, but with extended
--- capabilities.
---
--- A ReentrantLock is owned by the thread last
--- successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
--- lock will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
--- the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
--- immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
--- be checked using methods isHeldByCurrentThread(), and getHoldCount().
---
--- The constructor for this class accepts an optional
--- fairness parameter.  When set true, under
--- contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
--- thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
--- access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
--- may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
--- slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
--- variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
--- starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
--- fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
--- fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
--- active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
--- lock.
--- Also note that the untimed tryLock() method does not
--- honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
--- is available even if other threads are waiting.
---
--- It is recommended practice to always immediately
--- follow a call to lock with a try block, most
--- typically in a before/after construction such as:
---
---  <code>
--- class X {
---   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
---   // ...
---
---   public void m() {
---     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
---     try {
---       // ... method body
---     } finally {
---       lock.unlock();
---     }
---   }
--- }</code>
---
--- In addition to implementing the Lock interface, this
--- class defines a number of public and protected
--- methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
--- methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
---
--- Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
--- locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
--- its state when serialized.
---
--- This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
--- the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
--- Error throws from locking methods.
