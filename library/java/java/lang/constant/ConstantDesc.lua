---(Not exposed)
---A nominal descriptor for a loadable
--- constant value, as defined in JVMS 4.4. Such a descriptor can be resolved via
--- resolveConstantDesc(MethodHandles.Lookup) to yield the
--- constant value itself.
---
--- Class names in a nominal descriptor, like class names in the constant pool
--- of a classfile, must be interpreted with respect to a particular class
--- loader, which is not part of the nominal descriptor.
---
--- Static constants that are expressible natively in the constant pool (String,
--- Integer, Long, Float, and Double) implement
--- ConstantDesc, and serve as nominal descriptors for themselves.
--- Native linkable constants (Class, MethodType, and
--- MethodHandle) have counterpart ConstantDesc types:
--- ClassDesc, MethodTypeDesc, and MethodHandleDesc.
--- Other constants are represented by subtypes of DynamicConstantDesc.
---
--- APIs that perform generation or parsing of bytecode are encouraged to use
--- ConstantDesc to describe the operand of an ldc instruction
--- (including dynamic constants), the static bootstrap arguments of
--- dynamic constants and invokedynamic instructions, and other
--- bytecodes or classfile structures that make use of the constant pool.
---
--- Constants describing various common constants (such as ClassDesc
--- instances for platform types) can be found in ConstantDescs.
---
--- Implementations of ConstantDesc should be immutable
--- and their behavior should not rely on object identity.
---
--- Non-platform classes should not implement ConstantDesc directly.
--- Instead, they should extend DynamicConstantDesc (as Enum.EnumDesc
--- and VarHandle.VarHandleDesc do.)
---
--- Nominal descriptors should be compared using the
--- Object.equals(Object) method. There is no guarantee that any
--- particular entity will always be represented by the same descriptor instance.
---@class ConstantDesc
local __ConstantDesc = {}

---Resolves this descriptor reflectively, emulating the resolution behavior
--- of JVMS 5.4.3 and the access control behavior of JVMS 5.4.4.  The resolution
--- and access control context is provided by the MethodHandles.Lookup
--- parameter.  No caching of the resulting value is performed.
---@param lookup MethodHandles.Lookup The MethodHandles.Lookup to provide name resolution
---               and access control context
---@return any # the resolved constant value
