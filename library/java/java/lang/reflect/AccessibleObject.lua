---(Not exposed)
---The AccessibleObject class is the base class for Field,
--- Method, and Constructor objects (known as reflected
--- objects). It provides the ability to flag a reflected object as
--- suppressing checks for Java language access control when it is used. This
--- permits sophisticated applications with sufficient privilege, such as Java
--- Object Serialization or other persistence mechanisms, to manipulate objects
--- in a manner that would normally be prohibited.
---
---  Java language access control prevents use of private members outside
--- their top-level class; package access members outside their package; protected members
--- outside their package or subclasses; and public members outside their
--- module unless they are declared in an exported package and the user reads their module. By
--- default, Java language access control is enforced (with one variation) when
--- Fields, Methods, or Constructors are used to get or
--- set fields, to invoke methods, or to create and initialize new instances of
--- classes, respectively. Every reflected object checks that the code using it
--- is in an appropriate class, package, or module. The check when invoked by
--- JNI code with no Java
--- class on the stack only succeeds if the member and the declaring class are
--- public, and the class is in a package that is exported to all modules.
---
---  The one variation from Java language access control is that the checks
--- by reflected objects assume readability. That is, the module containing
--- the use of a reflected object is assumed to read the module in which
--- the underlying field, method, or constructor is declared.
---
---  Whether the checks for Java language access control can be suppressed
--- (and thus, whether access can be enabled) depends on whether the reflected
--- object corresponds to a member in an exported or open package
--- (see setAccessible(boolean)).
---@class AccessibleObject: AnnotatedElement
local __AccessibleObject = {}

---Test if the caller can access this reflected object. If this reflected
--- object corresponds to an instance method or field then this method tests
--- if the caller can access the given obj with the reflected object.
--- For instance methods or fields then the obj argument must be an
--- instance of the declaring class. For
--- static members and constructors then obj must be null.
---
---  This method returns true if the accessible flag
--- is set to true, i.e. the checks for Java language access control
--- are suppressed, or if the caller can access the member as
--- specified in The Java Language Specification,
--- with the variation noted in the class description.

---            object if it is an instance method or field

---
--- If there are no annotations associated with this element, the return

---
--- The difference between this method and AnnotatedElement.getAnnotation(Class)

---
--- The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will

---Returns this element's annotation(s) for the specified type if

--- annotations.
---
--- If there are no specified annotations directly or indirectly

--- 0.
---
--- The difference between this method and AnnotatedElement.getDeclaredAnnotation(Class) is that this method detects if its

---@return boolean # the value of the object's accessible flag
function __AccessibleObject:isAccessible() end

---Returns true if an annotation for the specified type
--- is present on this element, else false.  This method
--- is designed primarily for convenient access to marker annotations.
---
--- The truth value returned by this method is equivalent to:
--- getAnnotation(annotationClass) != null
---@param annotationClass Class<Annotation> the Class object corresponding to the
---        annotation type
---@return boolean # true if an annotation for the specified annotation
---     type is present on this element, else false
function __AccessibleObject:isAnnotationPresent(annotationClass) end

---Set the accessible flag for this reflected object to
--- the indicated boolean value.  A value of true indicates that
--- the reflected object should suppress checks for Java language access
--- control when it is used. A value of false indicates that
--- the reflected object should enforce checks for Java language access
--- control when it is used, with the variation noted in the class description.
---
---  This method may be used by a caller in class C to enable
--- access to a member of declaring class D if any of the following hold:
---
---
---      C and D are in the same module.
---
---      The member is public and D is public in
---     a package that the module containing D exports to at least the module
---     containing C.
---
---      The member is protected static, D is
---     public in a package that the module containing D
---     exports to at least the module containing C, and C
---     is a subclass of D.
---
---      D is in a package that the module containing D
---     opens to at least the module
---     containing C.
---     All packages in unnamed and open modules are open to all modules and
---     so this method always succeeds when D is in an unnamed or
---     open module.
---
---
---  This method cannot be used to enable access to private members,
--- members with default (package) access, protected instance members, or
--- protected constructors when the declaring class is in a different module
--- to the caller and the package containing the declaring class is not open
--- to the caller's module.
---
---  This method cannot be used to enable write
--- access to a non-modifiable final field.  The following fields
--- are non-modifiable:
---
--- static final fields declared in any class or interface
--- final fields declared in a hidden class
--- final fields declared in a record
---
---  The accessible flag when true suppresses Java language access
--- control checks to only enable read access to
--- these non-modifiable final fields.
---
---  If there is a security manager, its
--- checkPermission method is first called with a
--- ReflectPermission("suppressAccessChecks") permission.
---@param flag boolean the new value for the accessible flag
function __AccessibleObject:setAccessible(flag) end

---Set the accessible flag for this reflected object to true
--- if possible. This method sets the accessible flag, as if by
--- invoking setAccessible(true), and returns
--- the possibly-updated value for the accessible flag. If access
--- cannot be enabled, i.e. the checks or Java language access control cannot
--- be suppressed, this method returns false (as opposed to
--- setAccessible(true) throwing InaccessibleObjectException when
--- it fails).
---
---  This method is a no-op if the accessible flag for
--- this reflected object is true.
---
---  For example, a caller can invoke trySetAccessible
--- on a Method object for a private instance method
--- p.T::privateMethod to suppress the checks for Java language access
--- control when the Method is invoked.
--- If p.T class is in a different module to the caller and
--- package p is open to at least the caller's module,
--- the code below successfully sets the accessible flag
--- to true.
---
---
--- <code>
---     p.T obj = ....;  // instance of p.T
---     :
---     Method m = p.T.class.getDeclaredMethod("privateMethod");
---     if (m.trySetAccessible()) {
---         m.invoke(obj);
---     } else {
---         // package p is not opened to the caller to access private member of T
---         ...
---     }
--- </code>
---
---  If there is a security manager, its checkPermission method
--- is first called with a ReflectPermission("suppressAccessChecks")
--- permission.
---@return boolean # true if the accessible flag is set to true;
---         false if access cannot be enabled.
function __AccessibleObject:trySetAccessible() end
