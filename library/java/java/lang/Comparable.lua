---@meta _

---(Not exposed)
---This interface imposes a total ordering on the objects of each class that
--- implements it.  This ordering is referred to as the class's natural
--- ordering, and the class's compareTo method is referred to as
--- its natural comparison method.
---
--- Lists (and arrays) of objects that implement this interface can be sorted
--- automatically by Collections.sort (and
--- Arrays.sort).  Objects that implement this
--- interface can be used as keys in a sorted map or as
--- elements in a sorted set, without the need to
--- specify a comparator.
---
--- The natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistent
--- with equals if and only if e1.compareTo(e2) == 0 has
--- the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every
--- e1 and e2 of class C.  Note that null
--- is not an instance of any class, and e.compareTo(null) should
--- throw a NullPointerException even though e.equals(null)
--- returns false.
---
--- It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be
--- consistent with equals.  This is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps)
--- without explicit comparators behave "strangely" when they are used with
--- elements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals.  In
--- particular, such a sorted set (or sorted map) violates the general contract
--- for set (or map), which is defined in terms of the equals
--- method.
---
--- For example, if one adds two keys a and b such that
--- (!a.equals(b) && a.compareTo(b) == 0) to a sorted
--- set that does not use an explicit comparator, the second add
--- operation returns false (and the size of the sorted set does not increase)
--- because a and b are equivalent from the sorted set's
--- perspective.
---
--- Virtually all Java core classes that implement Comparable
--- have natural orderings that are consistent with equals.  One
--- exception is BigDecimal, whose natural ordering equates
--- BigDecimal objects with equal numerical values and different
--- representations (such as 4.0 and 4.00). For BigDecimal.equals() to return true,
--- the representation and numerical value of the two
--- BigDecimal objects must be the same.
---
--- For the mathematically inclined, the relation that defines
--- the natural ordering on a given class C is:<code>
---       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) <= 0}.
--- </code> The quotient for this total order is: <code>
---       {(x, y) such that x.compareTo(y) == 0}.
--- </code>
---
--- It follows immediately from the contract for compareTo that the
--- quotient is an equivalence relation on C, and that the
--- natural ordering is a total order on C.  When we say that a
--- class's natural ordering is consistent with equals, we mean that the
--- quotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined by
--- the class's equals(Object) method:
---     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}.
---
--- In other words, when a class's natural ordering is consistent with
--- equals, the equivalence classes defined by the equivalence relation
--- of the equals method and the equivalence classes defined by
--- the quotient of the compareTo method are the same.
---
--- This interface is a member of the
---
--- Java Collections Framework.
---@class Comparable<T>
local __Comparable = {}

---Compares this object with the specified object for order.  Returns a
--- negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less
--- than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
---
--- The implementor must ensure signum(x.compareTo(y)) == -signum(y.compareTo(x)) for
--- all x and y.  (This implies that
--- x.compareTo(y) must throw an exception if and only if
--- y.compareTo(x) throws an exception.)
---
--- The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
--- (x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0) implies
--- x.compareTo(z) > 0.
---
--- Finally, the implementor must ensure that
--- x.compareTo(y)==0 implies that signum(x.compareTo(z))
--- == signum(y.compareTo(z)), for all z.
---@param o T the object to be compared.
---@return integer # a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object
---          is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.
