---An AttributedCharacterIterator allows iteration through both text and
--- related attribute information.
---
---
--- An attribute is a key/value pair, identified by the key.  No two
--- attributes on a given character can have the same key.
---
--- The values for an attribute are immutable, or must not be mutated
--- by clients or storage.  They are always passed by reference, and not
--- cloned.
---
--- A run with respect to an attribute is a maximum text range for
--- which:
---
--- the attribute is undefined or null for the entire range, or
--- the attribute value is defined and has the same non-null value for the
---     entire range.
---
---
--- A run with respect to a set of attributes is a maximum text range for
--- which this condition is met for each member attribute.
---
--- When getting a run with no explicit attributes specified (i.e.,
--- calling getRunStart() and getRunLimit()), any
--- contiguous text segments having the same attributes (the same set
--- of attribute/value pairs) are treated as separate runs if the
--- attributes have been given to those text segments separately.
---
--- The returned indexes are limited to the range of the iterator.
---
--- The returned attribute information is limited to runs that contain
--- the current character.
---
---
--- Attribute keys are instances of AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute and its
--- subclasses, such as TextAttribute.
---@class AttributedCharacterIterator

---(Not exposed)
---Defines attribute keys that are used to identify text attributes. These
--- keys are used in AttributedCharacterIterator and AttributedString.
---@class AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute

---@class CalendarBuilder

---(Not exposed)
---Defines constants that are used as attribute keys in the
--- AttributedCharacterIterator returned
--- from DateFormat.formatToCharacterIterator and as
--- field identifiers in FieldPosition.
---
--- The class also provides two methods to map
--- between its constants and the corresponding Calendar constants.

---DateFormatSymbols is a public class for encapsulating
--- localizable date-time formatting data, such as the names of the
--- months, the names of the days of the week, and the time zone data.
--- SimpleDateFormat uses
--- DateFormatSymbols to encapsulate this information.
---
---
--- Typically you shouldn't use DateFormatSymbols directly.
--- Rather, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with the
--- DateFormat class's factory methods: getTimeInstance,
--- getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance.
--- These methods automatically create a DateFormatSymbols for
--- the formatter so that you don't have to. After the
--- formatter is created, you may modify its format pattern using the
--- setPattern method. For more information about
--- creating formatters using DateFormat's factory methods,
--- see DateFormat.
---
---
--- If you decide to create a date-time formatter with a specific
--- format pattern for a specific locale, you can do so with:
---
---
--- new SimpleDateFormat(aPattern, DateFormatSymbols.getInstance(aLocale)).
---
---
---
--- If the locale contains "rg" (region override)
--- Unicode extension,
--- the symbols are overridden for the designated region.
---
---
--- DateFormatSymbols objects are cloneable. When you obtain
--- a DateFormatSymbols object, feel free to modify the
--- date-time formatting data. For instance, you can replace the localized
--- date-time format pattern characters with the ones that you feel easy
--- to remember. Or you can change the representative cities
--- to your favorite ones.
---
---
--- New DateFormatSymbols subclasses may be added to support
--- SimpleDateFormat for date-time formatting for additional locales.

---FieldPosition is a simple class used by Format
--- and its subclasses to identify fields in formatted output. Fields can
--- be identified in two ways:
---
---  By an integer constant, whose names typically end with
---      _FIELD. The constants are defined in the various
---      subclasses of Format.
---  By a Format.Field constant, see ERA_FIELD
---      and its friends in DateFormat for an example.
---
---
--- FieldPosition keeps track of the position of the
--- field within the formatted output with two indices: the index
--- of the first character of the field and the index of the last
--- character of the field.
---
---
--- One version of the format method in the various
--- Format classes requires a FieldPosition
--- object as an argument. You use this format method
--- to perform partial formatting or to get information about the
--- formatted output (such as the position of a field).
---
---
--- If you are interested in the positions of all attributes in the
--- formatted string use the Format method
--- formatToCharacterIterator.

---ParsePosition is a simple class used by Format
--- and its subclasses to keep track of the current position during parsing.
--- The parseObject method in the various Format
--- classes requires a ParsePosition object as an argument.
---
---
--- By design, as you parse through a string with different formats,
--- you can use the same ParsePosition, since the index parameter
--- records the current position.
