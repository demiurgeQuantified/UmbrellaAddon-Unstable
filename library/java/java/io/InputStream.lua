---@meta _

---(Not exposed)
---This abstract class is the superclass of all classes representing
--- an input stream of bytes.
---
---  Applications that need to define a subclass of InputStream
--- must always provide a method that returns the next byte of input.
---@class InputStream: Closeable
local __InputStream = {}

---Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped
--- over) from this input stream without blocking, which may be 0, or 0 when
--- end of stream is detected.  The read might be on the same thread or
--- another thread.  A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block,
--- but may read or skip fewer bytes.
---
---  Note that while some implementations of InputStream will
--- return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not.  It is
--- never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate
--- a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.
---
---  A subclass's implementation of this method may choose to throw an
--- IOException if this input stream has been closed by invoking the
--- close() method.
---
---  The available method of InputStream always returns
--- 0.
---
---  This method should be overridden by subclasses.
---@return integer # an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or
---             skipped over) from this input stream without blocking or
---             0 when it reaches the end of the input stream.
function __InputStream:available() end

---Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated
--- with the stream.
---
---  The close method of InputStream does
--- nothing.
function __InputStream:close() end

---Marks the current position in this input stream. A subsequent call to
--- the reset method repositions this stream at the last marked
--- position so that subsequent reads re-read the same bytes.
---
---  The readlimit arguments tells this input stream to
--- allow that many bytes to be read before the mark position gets
--- invalidated.
---
---  The general contract of mark is that, if the method
--- markSupported returns true, the stream somehow
--- remembers all the bytes read after the call to mark and
--- stands ready to supply those same bytes again if and whenever the method
--- reset is called.  However, the stream is not required to
--- remember any data at all if more than readlimit bytes are
--- read from the stream before reset is called.
---
---  Marking a closed stream should not have any effect on the stream.
---
---  The mark method of InputStream does
--- nothing.
---@param readlimit integer the maximum limit of bytes that can be read before
---                      the mark position becomes invalid.
function __InputStream:mark(readlimit) end

---Tests if this input stream supports the mark and
--- reset methods. Whether or not mark and
--- reset are supported is an invariant property of a
--- particular input stream instance. The markSupported method
--- of InputStream returns false.
---@return boolean # true if this stream instance supports the mark
---          and reset methods; false otherwise.
function __InputStream:markSupported() end

---Reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is
--- returned as an int in the range 0 to
--- 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream
--- has been reached, the value -1 is returned. This method
--- blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected,
--- or an exception is thrown.
---
---  A subclass must provide an implementation of this method.
---@return integer # the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the
---             stream is reached.
function __InputStream:read() end

---Reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into
--- the buffer array b. The number of bytes actually read is
--- returned as an integer.  This method blocks until input data is
--- available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown.
---
---  If the length of b is zero, then no bytes are read and
--- 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
--- least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at the
--- end of the file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at
--- least one byte is read and stored into b.
---
---  The first byte read is stored into element b[0], the
--- next one into b[1], and so on. The number of bytes read is,
--- at most, equal to the length of b. Let k be the
--- number of bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements
--- b[0] through b[k-1],
--- leaving elements b[k] through
--- b[b.length-1] unaffected.
---
---  The read(b) method for class InputStream
--- has the same effect as: <code> read(b, 0, b.length) </code>
---@param b kahlua.Array<integer> the buffer into which the data is read.
---@return integer # the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
---             -1 if there is no more data because the end of
---             the stream has been reached.
function __InputStream:read(b) end

---Reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into
--- an array of bytes.  An attempt is made to read as many as
--- len bytes, but a smaller number may be read.
--- The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer.
---
---  This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is
--- detected, or an exception is thrown.
---
---  If len is zero, then no bytes are read and
--- 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
--- least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of
--- file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one
--- byte is read and stored into b.
---
---  The first byte read is stored into element b[off], the
--- next one into b[off+1], and so on. The number of bytes read
--- is, at most, equal to len. Let k be the number of
--- bytes actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements
--- b[off] through b[off+k-1],
--- leaving elements b[off+k] through
--- b[off+len-1] unaffected.
---
---  In every case, elements b[0] through
--- b[off-1] and elements b[off+len] through
--- b[b.length-1] are unaffected.
---
---  The read(b, off, len) method
--- for class InputStream simply calls the method
--- read() repeatedly. If the first such call results in an
--- IOException, that exception is returned from the call to
--- the read(b, off, len) method.  If
--- any subsequent call to read() results in a
--- IOException, the exception is caught and treated as if it
--- were end of file; the bytes read up to that point are stored into
--- b and the number of bytes read before the exception
--- occurred is returned. The default implementation of this method blocks
--- until the requested amount of input data len has been read,
--- end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. Subclasses are
--- encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
---@param b kahlua.Array<integer> the buffer into which the data is read.
---@param off integer the start offset in array b
---                   at which the data is written.
---@param len integer the maximum number of bytes to read.
---@return integer # the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
---             -1 if there is no more data because the end of
---             the stream has been reached.
function __InputStream:read(b, off, len) end

---Reads all remaining bytes from the input stream. This method blocks until
--- all remaining bytes have been read and end of stream is detected, or an
--- exception is thrown. This method does not close the input stream.
---
---  When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
--- method will return an empty byte array.
---
---  Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
--- convenient to read all bytes into a byte array. It is not intended for
--- reading input streams with large amounts of data.
---
---  The behavior for the case where the input stream is asynchronously
--- closed, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
--- stream specific, and therefore not specified.
---
---  If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
--- so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
--- stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
--- It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
--- error occurs.
---@return kahlua.Array<integer> # a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream
function __InputStream:readAllBytes() end

---Reads up to a specified number of bytes from the input stream. This
--- method blocks until the requested number of bytes has been read, end
--- of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. This method does not
--- close the input stream.
---
---  The length of the returned array equals the number of bytes read
--- from the stream. If len is zero, then no bytes are read and
--- an empty byte array is returned. Otherwise, up to len bytes
--- are read from the stream. Fewer than len bytes may be read if
--- end of stream is encountered.
---
---  When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
--- method will return an empty byte array.
---
---  Note that this method is intended for simple cases where it is
--- convenient to read the specified number of bytes into a byte array. The
--- total amount of memory allocated by this method is proportional to the
--- number of bytes read from the stream which is bounded by len.
--- Therefore, the method may be safely called with very large values of
--- len provided sufficient memory is available.
---
---  The behavior for the case where the input stream is asynchronously
--- closed, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
--- stream specific, and therefore not specified.
---
---  If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
--- so after some, but not all, bytes have been read. Consequently the input
--- stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
--- It is strongly recommended that the stream be promptly closed if an I/O
--- error occurs.
---@param len integer the maximum number of bytes to read
---@return kahlua.Array<integer> # a byte array containing the bytes read from this input stream
function __InputStream:readNBytes(len) end

---Reads the requested number of bytes from the input stream into the given
--- byte array. This method blocks until len bytes of input data have
--- been read, end of stream is detected, or an exception is thrown. The
--- number of bytes actually read, possibly zero, is returned. This method
--- does not close the input stream.
---
---  In the case where end of stream is reached before len bytes
--- have been read, then the actual number of bytes read will be returned.
--- When this stream reaches end of stream, further invocations of this
--- method will return zero.
---
---  If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is
--- returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read up to len bytes.
---
---  The first byte read is stored into element b[off], the next
--- one in to b[off+1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at
--- most, equal to len. Let k be the number of bytes actually
--- read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[off] through
--- b[off+k-1], leaving elements b[off+k
--- ] through b[off+len-1] unaffected.
---
---  The behavior for the case where the input stream is asynchronously
--- closed, or the thread interrupted during the read, is highly input
--- stream specific, and therefore not specified.
---
---  If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream, then it may do
--- so after some, but not all, bytes of b have been updated with
--- data from the input stream. Consequently the input stream and b
--- may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly recommended that the
--- stream be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.
---@param b kahlua.Array<integer> the byte array into which the data is read
---@param off integer the start offset in b at which the data is written
---@param len integer the maximum number of bytes to read

function __InputStream:readNBytes(b, off, len) end

---Repositions this stream to the position at the time the
--- mark method was last called on this input stream.
---
---  The general contract of reset is:
---
---
---  If the method markSupported returns
--- true, then:
---
---      If the method mark has not been called since
---     the stream was created, or the number of bytes read from the stream
---     since mark was last called is larger than the argument
---     to mark at that last call, then an
---     IOException might be thrown.
---
---      If such an IOException is not thrown, then the
---     stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the
---     most recent call to mark (or since the start of the
---     file, if mark has not been called) will be resupplied
---     to subsequent callers of the read method, followed by
---     any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of
---     the time of the call to reset.
---
---  If the method markSupported returns
--- false, then:
---
---      The call to reset may throw an
---     IOException.
---
---      If an IOException is not thrown, then the stream
---     is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the
---     input stream and how it was created. The bytes that will be supplied
---     to subsequent callers of the read method depend on the
---     particular type of the input stream.
---
--- The method reset for class InputStream
--- does nothing except throw an IOException.
function __InputStream:reset() end

---Skips over and discards n bytes of data from this input
--- stream. The skip method may, for a variety of reasons, end
--- up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly 0.
--- This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file
--- before n bytes have been skipped is only one possibility.
--- The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If n is
--- negative, the skip method for class InputStream always
--- returns 0, and no bytes are skipped. Subclasses may handle the negative
--- value differently.
---
---  The skip method implementation of this class creates a
--- byte array and then repeatedly reads into it until n bytes
--- have been read or the end of the stream has been reached. Subclasses are
--- encouraged to provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
--- For instance, the implementation may depend on the ability to seek.
---@param n integer the number of bytes to be skipped.
---@return integer # the actual number of bytes skipped which might be zero.
function __InputStream:skip(n) end

---Skips over and discards exactly n bytes of data from this input
--- stream.  If n is zero, then no bytes are skipped.
--- If n is negative, then no bytes are skipped.
--- Subclasses may handle the negative value differently.
---
---  This method blocks until the requested number of bytes has been
--- skipped, end of file is reached, or an exception is thrown.
---
---  If end of stream is reached before the stream is at the desired
--- position, then an EOFException is thrown.
---
---  If an I/O error occurs, then the input stream may be
--- in an inconsistent state. It is strongly recommended that the
--- stream be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.
---@param n integer the number of bytes to be skipped.

---Reads all bytes from this input stream and writes the bytes to the
--- given output stream in the order that they are read. On return, this
--- input stream will be at end of stream. This method does not close either
--- stream.
---
--- This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream, or
--- writing to the output stream. The behavior for the case where the input
--- and/or output stream is asynchronously closed, or the thread
--- interrupted during the transfer, is highly input and output stream
--- specific, and therefore not specified.
---
--- If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to the
--- output stream, then it may do so after some bytes have been read or
--- written. Consequently the input stream may not be at end of stream and
--- one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
--- recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.
