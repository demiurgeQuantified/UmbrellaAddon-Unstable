---(Not exposed)
---A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
--- such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30.
---
--- LocalDateTime is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time,
--- often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Other date and time fields,
--- such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
--- Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
--- For example, the value "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789" can be
--- stored in a LocalDateTime.
---
--- This class does not store or represent a time-zone.
--- Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with
--- the local time as seen on a wall clock.
--- It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
--- such as an offset or time-zone.
---
--- The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
--- in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
--- system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
--- For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
--- However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
--- to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
---
--- This is a value-based
--- class; programmers should treat instances that are
--- equal as interchangeable and should not
--- use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
--- occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
--- The equals method should be used for comparisons.
